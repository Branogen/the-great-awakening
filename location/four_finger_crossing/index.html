You can barely call it home and you certainly can’t call it town but regardless of what you wish to call it you can buy anything in its narrow alleyways and open markets. Really, anything; food, weapons, magic items, guides and more… shady… things. But be careful where you step and when you choose to be there, Four Finger Crossing has no law.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Big sprawling mess<br><strong>Connects to:</strong> Oldtown, Redmoore, Silverpine Port and Annuvien</p>
