Really, anything; food, weapons, magic items, guides and more… shady… things. But be careful where you step and when you choose to be there, Four Finger Crossing has no law.</p><h3 class="h3"><a href="/the-great-awakening/location/orrin/">Orrin</a></h3><p>Merchant town known for its trade of magical artifacts</p><h3 class="h3"><a href="/the-great-awakening/location/redmoore/">Redmoore</a></h3><script src="/the-great-awakening/js/index.js"></script></div></body></html>
