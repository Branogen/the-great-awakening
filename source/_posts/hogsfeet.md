**Size:** Small village  
**Has teleportation circle:** YES

Hogsfeet village has been inhabited for centuries. Its location, hidden nicely behind Blacktyde island meant that village was not exposed to the periodic "The Great Waves", unlike other small villages by sea, making life there less stressful and more peaceful. Its main exports were fish and fruits from the nearby Devil's orchard.

East of the village lies foreign island of Khyran which hosted university that was said to be one of the finest in the world. Decades ago, island was involved in a war and huge explosion happened there. Since then, Island has been abandoned and even though it officially still belongs to the kingdom that lies east of Tookania, it is now considered no-mans-land, primarily due to evil curse. Brave people of Hogsfeet and other nearby settlements wanted to explore the island, but they discovered terrible truth. Anyone that stepped on the island got sick shortly after and without the help of magical healing (which most people could not afford) died within months.

But then crafty Dwarf artificer named Bogroda arrived into town. Like most educated people, she knew that curses do not exist just because. Even if there is an actual curse, it usually originates from something, like an evil object. She and her cleric elf friend Almar (that help counter the effects off the island) set sail to the island and decided to figure out what is going on.

After some time of observation, Bogroda figured out that island is covered in green mineral that radiates energy around it. This energy caused damage to people's bodies, causing them to die in months. Crafty artificer that she is, she also tried to make something practical out of it and found out that when this mineral is properly processed, it can be used to fuel weak magic spells seemingly indefinitely. She started gathering this mineral, now called Urah by her, crafting it into ever lasting lamps that do not need to be periodically re-lit by a spellcaster and then selling the lamps. 

Since those lamps did not need periodic visits by pesky Wizards, demand for the lamps turned out to be big. That made Bogroda decide to invite her best friends - classmates from magic academy she studied in - to the project. Together they created the company called "Project Kheern", started mass mining this material and over time invented various items and processes that helped making mining process safer, despite the very dangerous mineral. Today, Project Kheern is one of the biggest companies in all of Tookania and it employs over half of the Hogsfeet population.
