## Climbing

You can climb vertical surfaces that are not smooth (that have enough holes and/or protrusions to use as handhold). If you do not have explciit climbing speed, you can climb for half of your normal speed (for example you can only climb 15 feet if you have movement speed of 30. Rounds up). You cannot dash-climb (dash action only works on horizontal movement).

While clinging to a vertical surface, your hands and feet are used to hold yourself up. You cannot perform any actions that require them (for example you cannot cast spells with somatic component).

Before every [your climbing speed] ft of climbing (including at the start) you have to make athletics check. If you fail, you let go from the surface, fall to the ground and fall prone (you do not fall prone if you fell from less than 5 ft). You cannot climb again this turn. DCs for various surfaces:

- Rope
  - 7
  - Special: When falling from the rope, you first slide down to the bottom end of the rope and then fall down from the end of the rope (fall damage only applies from the height of the rope&#39;s bottom end)
- Dry coarse rock
  - 8
- Stone wall
  - 10
- Coarse hard snow
  - 10

Climber&#39;s kit works similarly as described in the official rules. Clarifications and changes:

- Kit basically consists of two climber&#39;s pitons and 25ft of rope
- When anchoring, player can pick any rope length up to 25 ft instead always having 25 feet.
- Instead of moving down, unanchoring and moving back up, you can just expend your whole movement and bonus action to unanchor your piton anywhere within rope&#39;s range (just to speed up gameplay)
- Pitons from the climber&#39;s kit can only hold one person on the rope attached to them. If second person attempts to climb on the same rope, piton holding the rope unanchors.

## Walking on ice

- If you Dash and your path of dashing includes ice, you must make DC (8 + incline in ft) acrobatics check first. If you fail, your dash action is wasted and you fall prone
  - Incline in ft = vertical increase per 5 ft of surface. You always use highest incline over the whole path you tried to dash through for calculation
- Walking uphill requires double movement cost (you have to be extra careful)

## Holding the rope

If your characters holds the rope at the top of the cliff, you must make Strength check every time new person starts climbing on your rope. DC is _(8 + number of people already on the rope \* 3)_. If you fail, you let go of the rope. If multiple people hold the same rope, all rope holders roll the check and you sum the result. If one of the rope holders lets go of the rope, the rest of the holders must immediately re-do this strength check.

When holding the rope with people on it, you can use your action to pull the rope up. Roll D20. You can pull the rope up by
(_(Dice result + strength modifier) / 2 - people on the rope \* 3,_ rounding up) ft. If other people also hold the same rope, they can spend their reaction to help you pull rope up. They make the same roll and you sum the results. If any person rolls 1, that person lets the rope go (he can take hold of the rope again as action on his next turn).

If rope is also attached to the anchored piton, use the same rules as if piton was the person that holds the rope and always rolls 8 (with +0 strength). Piton can&#39;t help moving the rope up.

## Fall damage on snow

When falling onto snow, you reduce your fall damage as if you fell by 15ft less.



**Do not forget:** Objects also have HP ([https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Objects](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Objects#content)). If you throw down an object to your ally and that idiot does not catch it, it can get damaged or even destroyed by the fall damage. Be careful with your magical items ;)
