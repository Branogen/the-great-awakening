### Shield
Hammer can produce translucent rectangular 15ft x 8ft barrier with the center on the hammer's head.

When shield is deployed, nobody on the "other side" of the shield cannot target creatures on "your side" of the shield. Instead they can only target the shield itself, which has AC of 11. Player holding the hammer also cannot perform any action, bonus action or reaction, except lowering the shield. Player's movement speed is also halved.

### Bonus HP
Hammer has secret button on the bottom of its handle. When pressed, it abosrbs energy from the air around the hammer and potentially gain bonus HP for the hammer. This HP is limited to (user's level) * 10 and disappears after 1 hour of shield not being deployed. When shield is hit, bonus HP is reduced first, then main HP. How to gain bonus HP:
___
***Powerful artifats*** If you press the button near powerful artifact that radiates energy, hammer may absorb that energy. Amount gained depends on the artifact
___
***Spells*** When an attack spell of level 1 or higher attacks hammer directly (AC = 11), user can press the button on the hammer as a reaction to absorb the spell. Attacker rolls damage normally and his damage is instead added to the hammer's pool of bonus HP. Spell is extinguished and any other effects of the spell are discarded. If user does not absorb the spell, attack counts as a normal attack on the shield, except that it does nothing if hammer is already at 0HP.
___
If Bonus HP Pool of the hammer is already full, button does nothing.
### Charges
Hammer can gain charges when shield is deployed. Any damage absorbed by the shield gains 
*floor(damage / 5)* charges to the hammer.
___
When the hammer hits the target, it deals additional *(charges)*d4 damage and resets the charge counter to zero. Charge counter also resets to 0 by itself after 1 hour of shield not being deployed.

### Actions
***Deploy Shield.*** Pick any amount of HP up to (your HP - 1) and transfer that into the shield. Then you raise the shield in front of you.   
___
___
### Bonus Actions
***Lower shield.*** Shield shuts down and any leftover HP from the shield is transferred back to the player.
