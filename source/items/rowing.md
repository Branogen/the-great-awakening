You are in a keel boat. There are four rowing stations.

**Rough seas**

Sea is rough, boat is constantly rocking around and the deck is slippery.

- You can use half of your movement freely (e.g. moving slowly and carefully)
- If you want to use full movement (and/or Dash), before you start moving, roll DC 11 acrobatics check. If you fail, you fall prone and loose all your movement for this turn.
- If you are prone, you can expend half of your movement first to stand up and then perform DEX check to move for the second half
- This limitation always uses your full speed, ignoring any other limitation. For example if your speed is 30ft and something else limits you to only 15 ft, you can still move freely for whole 15 ft (but you cannot roll DEX since you only have 15 ft of whole movement due to other limit).

**Boat movement**

After last entity in initiaitve finishes its turn, boat can move forward. Everyone sitting in the rowing station rolls strength check and sum the results. Boat moves RESULT \* 20ft forward.

**Water is rushing in!**

After boat movement, 1d4 hL of water rushes into the boat if the boat has open hole.
