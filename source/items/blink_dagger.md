### Bonus Actions

***Blink*** Usable after successful throwing attack, when dagger is embedded in enemy's guts. Raise your hand and you will teleport to the dagger, holding it in your hand as if you just stabbed the enemy. Blink has 3 uses per short rest (short rest counts for a first person that used the dagger today).

***Recall*** Usable when dagger is not embedded in anything (for example when it falls to the ground after failed attack). Raise your hand and dagger appears in your palm.

Maximum range of both actions is 70ft.

Note: You can also perform attack rolls on stationary objects (for example you can attempt to "attack" stone wall. If your attack succeds and dagger gets embedded into stone wall, you can use Blink bonus action to teleport there).
