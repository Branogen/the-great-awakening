## Miscellaneous rules

### Darkvision in pitch darkness

* You can only see rough black and white outlines of objects
* Your Passive perception decreases by 5
* Perception rolls that rely on sight have disadvantage or might even auto-fail (at GM’s discretion)
* You cannot read, unless the text is really huge
* If the target is >=30ft away from you, you cannot see it clearly anymore. All attack rolls based on sight have disadvantage.
* If there is any light source within the range of your darkvision, your eyes adjust to that light source and you loose dark vision until light source is removed.
    
### Weekly payments

* Characters may, as the part of the story, need to give or receive weekly payments
(for example, a sallary)
* For simplciity purposes, these payments are given per-session since session occurs once per week (no need to count in-game days)
* Payment may skip the session on GM’s discretion if session took very short span of in-game time
