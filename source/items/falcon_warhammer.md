### Shield
Hammer can produce translucent rectangular 15ft x 8ft barrier with the center on the hammer's head. Barrier can only be deployed in 45 degree increments on the combat grid.

When shield is deployed, nobody on the "other side" of the shield cannot target creatures on "your side" of the shield. Instead they can only target the shield itself, which has AC of 11. Player holding the hammer also cannot perform any action, bonus action or reaction, except lowering the shield. Player's movement speed is also halved.

When deployed, barrier also acts like impassable physical barrier from both side. On your side, barrier feels like very smooth cold glass to the touch. On other side barrier feels like very hot glass (so hot that your reflexes immediately make you let go when you touch it).

### Bonus HP
Hammer has secret button on the bottom of its handle. When pressed, it abosrbs energy from the air around the hammer and potentially gain bonus HP for the hammer. This HP is limited to (user's level) * 10 and disappears after 1 hour of shield not being deployed. When shield is hit, bonus HP is reduced first, then main HP. How to gain bonus HP:
___
***Powerful artifats*** If you press the button near powerful artifact that radiates energy, hammer may absorb that energy. Amount gained depends on the artifact
___
***Damage Spells*** When an attack spell of level 1 or higher attacks hammer directly (AC = 11), user can press the button on the hammer as a reaction to absorb the spell. Attacker rolls damage normally and his damage is instead added to the hammer's pool of bonus HP. Spell is extinguished and any other effects of the spell are discarded. If user does not absorb the spell, attack counts as a normal attack on the shield, except that it does nothing if hammer is already at 0HP.
___
***Healing Spells/actions*** Any healing spells/actions that can target creatures can also target shield. When caster casts healing spell/action, user can press the button on the hammer as a reaction to absorb the spell. Healer finishes casting heal spell normally and hammer receives double of the HP that spell/action would heal as bonus HP (up to max bonus HP in the hammer).
___
If Bonus HP Pool of the hammer is already full, button does nothing.
### Energy Pool

Whenever shield receives the damage, take note of the total received damage (damage counter). This number counts as energy pool for the hammer that can be used for the actions below.

Energy counter is automatically reset to zero whenever any action that uses it is used or 1 hour after lowering the shield, whichever comes sooner.

### Actions
***Deploy Shield.*** Pick any amount of HP up to (your HP - 1) and transfer that into the shield. Then you raise the shield in front of you.   
***Fire Strike.*** 10ft long wall of flame bursts out along whole width of the shield (on the "other" side). Every creature in area must make DC 14 dexterity saving throw. A creature takes *(floor(damage counter / 4))d4* fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful save. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.

### Bonus Actions
***Lower shield.*** Shield shuts down and any leftover HP from the shield is transferred back to the player.
