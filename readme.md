# The Great Awakening

Campaign log and diary for local D&D group. `master` branch contains theme and source files, `gh-pages` contains generated and deployed site.

## How to contribute
Clone repo. Optionally run `npm run install-cli` to install global Hexo CLI but you can always generate new pages without CLI, read the [docs](https://hexo.io/docs/writing). Run `npm run start` to start local server and then create or edit markdown files. Server watches for changes, you just need to reload site. When you want to deploy, run `npm run deploy`.

## Some notes on organization
Hexo recognizes different page layouts, we are using pages and blog posts. Pages describe towns, events, characters or any similar piece of knowledge. Posts are meant for personal character's diary, don't forget to tag them with your character's name. :wink:
